Introduction/Business Problem

Target: Property investors, people looking to move into London.

Problem: Accommodation prices in central and urban London is very high, and this may be daunting to people who are looking to move into London for whatever reasons.
While for investors with smaller fund pools, urban properties may be too expensive to deal with. 
House prices in suburban areas of London are dramatically cheaper, and thus it maybe more appealing to specific groups of investors or people looking to move into London. 
Properties in the suburb are cheap, but this comes with a tradeoff of having less access and venues. 
In this project, I would like to examine how the living environment of each London suburbs differ, 
from the perspective of available venues, crime rates and unemployment rates in the area. 
The main goal of this project is to find the suburb with best investment potential (among the other suburbs), based on living environments.
